    <h2>Delicious trout tacos</h2>
    <p>
      These trout tacos take advantage of trout's mild, delicate flavor. With a
      semi-homemade slaw, crema, lime, and guacamole, these fish tacos are
      really tasty.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Wrap tortillas in
        foil.
      </li>
      <li>Bake tortillas in the preheated oven until warm, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, place cabbage, white parts of green onion, coleslaw mix, 3
        tablespoons Mexican crema, lime zest, juice of 2 lime wedges, and
        cilantro in a large bowl. Toss to coat; season with salt and pepper. Set
        aside..
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully remove skin from trout. Cut each trout filet into 2- to 3-inch
        pieces. Stir tapioca starch, cumin, chipotle powder, and Mexican oregano
        together in a shallow bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Dip fish pieces into seasoning mixture to coat.</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add coated
        fish pieces; cook until golden brown and fish flakes easily with a fork,
        2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a drip tray, and season with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using 2 corn tortillas for each taco, divide fish, slaw, and guacamole
        between the tacos. Garnish each with green tops of scallions. Serve with
        remaining lime wedges and crema on the side. Enjoy!
